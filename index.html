        Atlas Typewriter, designed by Susana Carvalho and Kai Bernau, extends the usefulness of the Atlas Collection. 
        A distinctive monospaced face, it is well suited for a wide range of uses, from art catalogues to personal 
        correspondence, through to data visualization.

          Rather than hewing closely to the model of existing monospaced typefaces, Atlas Typewriter aims for an even, 
          readable texture with the same clean and effortless tone as the Grotesk. Characters like f and t are 
          distinctively symmetrical, while the r is unadorned with extraneous serifs or terminals, making it neater and 
          less distracting in text than in a typical monospaced sans. Like Atlas Grotesk, Atlas Typewriter is drawn for 
          both text and display use in a full range of 6 weights, all with italics and small capitals.
