          <p><i>Anatomy of an AI System</i> illustrates the relationship between the human and the machine as evolving technology and capitalism feed on convenience based consumerism and the impact this has on the earth and the labor exploitation of the workers involved in the process. The figure to the right demonstrates the complexity of extraction and production– each triangle representing a step of production and exploitation that contains previous phases.</p>

          <p>The text is based primarily on a visual representation of the authors’ understanding of the lifecycle of a single AI system. Although they argue it can be too complex to comprehend, they break down the diagram into parts, explaining the different sections along the way. Reading the map from left to right tells the story of the Earth, directly relating to the story of the human that can be read from top to bottom. </p>

          <p>Crawford and Jolen present us with an “exploded view of a planetary system across three stages of birth, life, and death” while analyzing a single AI system broken down into 21 parts. They focus on the Amazon Alexa, using it as a representation of the human-AI interaction and the complex nature of the relationship between the two. They hone in on the environmental damage of the process of producing and using AI systems, with Lithium extraction as the core example. The depletion of renewable resources that goes into making a human’s life more convenient is extremely damaging, but the authors make the argument that humans are also being exploited in the form of data labor by training these AI systems without intentionally consenting or knowing so.</p>

          <p>While the time period that Crawford and Jolen focus on is more or less current day (2018), the text brings in many historical references to support the analysis of the life cycle of an AI product. They introduce the concept of deep time, involving the Earth’s core and the mining that has taken place over generations. They consider three central processes required to run an artificial intelligence unit: material resources, human labor, and data that they consider across time, analyzing the lifespan of an Amazon Echo Unit at a planetary scale. The exploitation of labor is at the central focus of their investigation, as they argue this has been repeated throughout history. Digital labor, which leads to new accumulations of wealth and power, is concentrated to a small percentage of the population. The audience the authors are trying to reach is the general population, and people who interact with AI, which is just about everyone in the developed world, all of which are subject to digital labor. At the same time, they are targeting an audience who is also contributing to convenient consumerism, without knowledge that they are being used to train and optimize these AI systems. The authors state that the implications of AI is an ongoing timeline, and will be more significant than we can conceptualize at this point in time.</p>
